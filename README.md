# Youtube-Video-Summarizer
This Streamlit app summarizes YouTube videos by downloading audio, transcribing it with AssemblyAI, and generating a summary. Users input a YouTube URL, the app processes the audio, displays the transcription and summary, and provides a downloadable ZIP file with the results.
